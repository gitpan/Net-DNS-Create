Net::DNS::Create
================

### Create DNS configurations from a nice Perl structure based DSL.

Net::DNS::Create lets you specify your DNS configuration in a Perl script so
that all the duplication that normally occurs in DNS config files can be
expressed with variables and functions. This ultimately results in a
(hopefully) DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) representation of your DNS config
data, making it easier and less error prone to change.

Net::DNS::Create supports multiple backends which means you can change out
your DNS server software with minimal effort.

Backends are provided for:

  * [Bind](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/)
  * [TinyDNS](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html)
  * [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
